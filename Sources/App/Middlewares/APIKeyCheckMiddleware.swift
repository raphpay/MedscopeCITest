/// It checks the API key in the request headers against the hashed values stored in the database.
/// If the API key is valid, it allows the request to proceed.
/// If the API key is invalid, it throws an unauthorized error.
/// This middleware is used to protect routes that require authentication.
/// It is important to note that this middleware should be used in conjunction with the `APIKey` model,
/// which is responsible for storing the hashed API keys in the database.
